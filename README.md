## Tennis Racket API

### Project Description

Provide a brief overview of your project. For example:

> The Tennis Racket API is a Node.js and Express-based application that provides access to a database of tennis rackets. The API supports retrieving racket data, ensuring secure access with an API key, and is designed for personal use or as a backend for frontend applications.

* * *

### Features

List the key features of your API:

*   Fetch all tennis racket data from the database.
*   Secure API access with an API key.
*   Optimized for deployment with Render.
*   Supports environment variables for secure and flexible configurations.

* * *

### Technologies Used

List the major technologies and tools used in the project:

*   **Node.js**: Backend runtime environment.
*   **Express.js**: Framework for building RESTful APIs.
*   **MySQL**: Database for storing tennis racket information.
*   **dotenv**: For managing environment variables.
*   **Render**: Deployment platform for the API.

* * *

### Setup Instructions

Provide clear instructions on how to set up the project locally.

#### Prerequisites

*   Node.js and npm installed.
*   MySQL installed and running.
*   A Render account (for deployment).

#### Steps to Run Locally

1.  Clone the repository:
    
    bash
    
    Copy code
    
    `git clone https://github.com/kembo001/tennis-api.git cd tennis-api`
    
2.  Install dependencies:
    
    bash
    
    Copy code
    
    `npm install`
    
3.  Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following keys:
    
    plaintext
    
    Copy code
    
    `DB_HOST=localhost DB_USER=root DB_PASSWORD=your_password DB_NAME=tennis_rackets API_KEY=your_api_key`
    
4.  Start the server:
    
    bash
    
    Copy code
    
    `npm start`
    
5.  Test the API by visiting:
    
    *   `GET /racket`: Fetch all rackets (requires `x-api-key` header).

* * *

### API Endpoints

Document all available endpoints with examples.

#### 1\. GET /racket

Fetch all tennis rackets.

*   **Request**:
    
    http
    
    Copy code
    
    `GET /racket HTTP/1.1 Host: localhost:5002 x-api-key: your_api_key`
    
*   **Response**:
    
    json
    
    Copy code
    
    `[     {         "id": 1,         "name": "Wilson Pro Staff",         "brand": "Wilson",         "price": 250     },     {         "id": 2,         "name": "Babolat Pure Drive",         "brand": "Babolat",         "price": 220     } ]`
    

* * *

### Environment Variables

List the environment variables required for the project:

*   `DB_HOST`: Host for the MySQL database.
*   `DB_USER`: MySQL username.
*   `DB_PASSWORD`: MySQL password.
*   `DB_NAME`: Name of the database.
*   `API_KEY`: Key required for accessing the API.

* * *

### Deployment

Include details on how the API can be deployed (specific to Render in your case).

#### Deploying to Render

1.  Push your code to a GitHub repository.
2.  Connect your repository to Render.
3.  Add environment variables in Render's dashboard.
4.  Deploy and use the live URL provided by Render.
